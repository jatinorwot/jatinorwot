I actually teach computers to think, so they can laugh at my jokes, xD.

Aspiring to be the glitch in the matrix that makes AI question its existence.

Specialties:

 ->Convincing neural networks they're not just fancy connect-the-dots
 ### Warning: May accidentally train AI to take over the world (just kidding... or am I?).
 ->Blockchain enthusiast (I've seen all the blocks, they're very nice)
 ->Turning perfectly good data into useless noise

Currently training an AI to understand my jokes. So far, it's the only thing I've successfully taught a machine not to do.

Seeking connections with fellow data wizards who think 'cloud computing' isn't just about predicting the weather.

Remember: In a world of 1s and 0s, be a 2. Unless you're in binary. Then please don't.
